### 2. Version Differences

#### Sketch 1

```
It's very obvious that button is something that really intended to be clicked. So that's why I placed the button below the other existing button (stacked view) so user can see them like action center
```

#### Sketch 2

```
Since it's on the same context (beatmap page), so I think it's make sense to place it on same page both the beatmap info, discussion forum, and other relevant page then separate them into tab view.
```

#### Sketch 3
